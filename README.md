# NBA-Statistical-Analysis

Hey! Welcome to my project, NBA Statistical Analysis. The goal of this project is to analyze NBA game data to uncover insights from the following perspectives:

As an NBA Team Owner, I would like to know the players with the highest PER's so that I know who to target in free agency to provide the most excitement to my fans.

As an NBA Head Coach, I would like to know players' win/loss percentages so that our front office can target players with a winning pedigree in free agency.

As an NBA Player, I would like to know coaches with the highest PPG so that I can consider the right coach to unlock my offense
