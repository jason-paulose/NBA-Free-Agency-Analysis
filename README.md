# NBA-Free-Agency-Analysis

Hey! Welcome to my project, NBA Free Agency Analysis. Each NBA season, the excitement does not just end after the NBA championship, but the free agency period can seem like a exhilirating playoff run itself. As teams revaluate and retool their rosters, different statistics can drive action for each team depending on their needs. The goal of this project is to analyze NBA game data to uncover insights from the following perspectives:

1) As an NBA Team Owner, I would like to know the players' average points, rebounds, and assists so that I know who can provide the most excitement to my fans.

2) As an NBA Head Coach, I would like to know last season's players who are well above-average rebounders so that I know who can help my team gain more possessions.

3) As an NBA Team Owner, I would like to know the players' efficiency ratings so that I know who will have the most positive impacts on winning.

I address these user stories with the following SQL concepts:

- Aggregate Functions
- Joins
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions
- Stored Procedures
- Window Functions
